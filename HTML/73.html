<p>The oldest classical British and Latin writing had 
   little or no space between words and could be written 
   in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text
   direction (left to right) became standardized, and word dividers
   and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences
   into groups was the original paragraphos, similar 
   to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[1] 
   The Greek parágraphos evolved into the pilcrow (¶)
   which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences. 
   The hedera leaf (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the same way.
